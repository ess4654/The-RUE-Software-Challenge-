# The-RUE-Software-Challenge-
Designed for the best coders on earth to solve

The #rue software challenge was designed by me over the course of the past 2 months for the best coder I know to solve.

An old friend who hasn't spoken to me in 6 years. If he is as smart as other people tell me, he will already be working on the problem. As he's employed for a major tech company.

The #rue software challenge consists of a series of random "schizo" posts across my various social media accounts that are all related to each other.

Whoever can solve the problem of how these seemingly unrelated, relevant yet key pieces of information fit together will have solved the problem.

I am a software engineer with a perfect grade and will be homeless for the 6th time in 2 weeks. Make it make sense #rue

@elon musk has already been notified of the problem #rue

and if furries really do run the internet, they will be able to tell the rest of the public 

what #rue means.

321 Go!
#figure it out
